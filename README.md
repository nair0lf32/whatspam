# whatspam

A simple whatsapp spam tool with selenium and chrome webdriver

I made this script to learn a bit about selenium automation

Initially made using `wappdriver` but this package is now deprecated

Remade it to simply use selenium and chrome webdriver

It's basically a prank-spammer that automate your browser to send whatsapp messages

It's not fully tested yet, so minor errors might occur:

- you have to scan your QR code everytime 
(I could save user data locally to avoid that but for security reasons I prefer not)

Plus as a spammer you deserve to be annoyed a bit too hehe

- your internet connection have to be stable (I use implicit waiting time but you 
might want to increase it if your internet is slow)
- adapt your spam rate in configuration but remember it also depends on your internet speed
- Fill the required configuration in the code directly (no input to not break the execution flow)

And remember, spam is more annoying than funny

If your friends find it funny it's mostly because they might actually like you

No one likes spam! No ONE!
